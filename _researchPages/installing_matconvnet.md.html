MatconvNet and Compiling under Ubuntu 16
=================================================================

I setup MatConvNet for quick test in deep neural networks. I ran into a few problems and these solutions worked for me:

Warnings:
--------------------------------
 During compilation, Matlab kept giving me the following warning, even though the compilation was successful. I ignored it and kept going.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Warning: You are using gcc version '5.4.0'. The version of gcc is not supported. The version currently supported 
with MEX is '4.9.x'. For a list of currently supported compilers see: 
http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/current_release. 
> In vl_compilenn>mex_link (line 547)
  In vl_compilenn (line 498) 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Error:
----------------------------------
After compilation, I tried to run a sample. At this point, MATLAB gave an error involving not finding the right libstdc++.so.6 and some GLIBCXX error thing. After searching the web, I added this line to ./bashrc. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That did not work on sourcing bashrc, closing terminals, and opening terminals to restart matlab.

Then, I tried another idea I saw. It involved downloading libstdc and installing that. I then added the following to ./bashrc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As before, it did not work. 


Finally, creating a softlink from the version in my ubuntu to /usr/local/MATLAB/R2016b/bin/glnx64/. The idea came from http://askubuntu.com/questions/575505/glibcxx-3-4-20-not-found-how-to-fix-this-error. So, from within the folder in matlab that should contain the libraries, I did:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 ./libstdc++.so.6

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That finally worked for my Matconvnet sample. The warning with compilation persists however.
