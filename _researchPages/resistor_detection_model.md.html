Resistor Detection in the Wild
===============================================================================

This post describes my research into detecting simple resistors (the sort used for breadboards)
in the wild. I begin with detecting and deciphering the resistor in a controlled setting where the resistor is placed on a white sheet of paper. Then I detail my work in deciphering in the wild when the resistor is in place on the breadboard. Please feel free to comment, suggest, and correct. 

In progress ---  REMOVE WHEN DONE.

Resistor detection in a Controlled Setting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project comes from my colleague, Usman. He is working on an AR application for undergraduates. In the application, the camera sees the entire breadboard as the student builds it and offers suggestions on the build, and corrections as are needed. An aspect of this application is detection of a resistor, and deciphering of resistor amount on the breadboard. As a start, I investigate what work has been done in detecting and deciphering resistors in a controlled setting.

Summary
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this work, we have explained how a TWM works. A TWM, designed for privacy, reflects most of the light hitting it, while allowing others to pass through. It is composed of a transparent medium, often glass, acrylic or some transparent plastic, coated with a very thin layer of a reflective medium, often silver or aluminium. A TWM acts like a mirror when the reflective side is much more brightly lit than the transparent side. In my next post, I will further explain the robotic mirror, my intended usage of the TWM.
