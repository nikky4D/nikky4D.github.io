In our work, we are concerned with simulating a mirror for augmented reality purposes. The long term goal is such that the user's mirror reflection is interaction agent, capable of moving/speaking independently of the user. The reflection agent, at the same time, will maintain a non-canny valley resemblance to the user (No freaking out). 

In this age of VR/AR headsets, it is natural to ask questions like why bother do this? Can't this be done in the VR world? Short answer, ... well yes. You can create your own VR/AR interaction agent. You, ... in general..., do not need to go our way of simulating a mirror with our prototype (which I will describe later). However, you forget that not everyone has the ability to wear headsets. Everyone cannot sit still to get a VR/AR model,
