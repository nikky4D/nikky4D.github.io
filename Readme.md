# Nkiruka Uzuegbunam Blog

This is my, Nkiruka Uzuegbunam, blog, uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I was tired of bloated, slow Wordpress that locked up all my content... Not really, ... just never had time to navigate all their pages and always forgot my password and login. So, I'm using this now.
